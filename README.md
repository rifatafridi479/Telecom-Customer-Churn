 # Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

ðŸ“ˆ Predicting customer churn and identifying the key factors which will influence to retain customers in future

## Project Overview
In the telecom industry, customer churn (when customers leave the service) is a major challenge. This project analyzes customer data to identify the major factors contributing to customer churn and builds a predictive model to help telecom companies retain customers.

## Motivation
In the telecom industry, customers frequently switch providers, leading to an average annual churn rate of 15-25%. Since acquiring a new customer costs 5-25 times more than retaining one, customer retention is now a top priority.
